### Gooday!
My name is snowy-the-arctic-fox, or more commonly known as Snowy. I am a developer, artist, furry, and a CGI artist. 

I'm currently learning Python, APIs, and AI.

### More information

My pronouns are as follows: He/They/She (any is fine)

Currently, my commisions are closed. Might reopen them soon

My "group" Aussie Furs

### Fun fact!

I have hederochromia, which means I have 2 different eye colours.

### Programs

As for programming, I am trying to make virtual machines more... accessable to the users across the world. Ranging from Windows to MacOS to even a chromebook! (hopefully)
