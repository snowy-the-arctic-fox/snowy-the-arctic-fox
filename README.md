### Good'ay!
My name is snowy-the-arctic-fox, or more commonly known as Snowy. I am a developer, artist, furry, and a CGI artist. 

I'm currently learning Python, APIs, and AI. I am rarely on VRChat, and if I am, I am most likely to be testing out a mod or tracking hardware I make (FloofVR)

### More information

My pronouns are as follows: He/They/She (any is fine)

Currently, my commisions are closed. Might reopen them soon

My "group" Aussie Furs

## Contact me!
my email is snowydev.github.developer@gmail.com

## Fun fact!

I have hederochromia, which means I have 2 different eye colours.

I have STML, which stands for short term memory loss.

I'm a music creator! (havent posted on spotify though)

## Programs

### Furry GPT
An extension to Chat GPT, Furry GPT gives out information like how a furry talks! 
#### **Warning** 
The Furry GPT AI can produce explicit responses. The clean version that is suitable for public use is still being worked on
### FurGen
This AI is a Fursona drawing mechanism. Input a text of your fursona and it will draw it perfectly!
#### **Warning** 
The FurGen AI can produce explicit images. The clean version that is suitable for public use is still being worked on, but there will be an app specifically made for explicit images.
### Megaman I TAS (full playthrough)
This is a TAS for the Megaman I game. Using FCEUX, an NES emulator, it can automatically play the game perfectly without taking damage! This is **not** AI. This TAS was created by me by typing in controller inputs for every frame of the game, allowing a completly damageless playthrough!
### General Programming
As for programming, I am trying to make virtual machines more... accessable to the users across the world. Ranging from Windows to MacOS to even a chromebook! (hopefully)
